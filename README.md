# Payment Refund Flow

The Payment Refund process involves reversing a payment transaction, either partially or fully. Similar to payment processing, the refund process also requires audit logging and backups to ensure traceability and compliance.

## Flow for Payment Refund

### 1. Trigger Refund Request

- A user initiates a refund request, which may be due to order cancellation, payment error, etc.
- The refund request is then sent to the payment processor (e.g., Flair Payment Gateway or another provider).

### 2. Payment Gateway Processes the Refund

- The payment processor validates the refund request and processes it by returning the specified amount to the userâ€™s payment method.
- A response is generated indicating the result (e.g., "Refund Successful" or "Refund Failed").

### 3. Record Refund in DynamoDB

- If the refund is successfully processed, the refund details are recorded in DynamoDB.
- The stored refund details include the following information:
  - Refund ID
  - Transaction ID
  - User
  - Refunded Amount
  - Refund Status

### 4. Create Audit Trail for Refund

- An audit trail is created to log the refund process for traceability.
- This trail records:
  - Who processed the refund
  - When it occurred
  - Refund transaction details
  - Outcome (e.g., "Refund Successful" or "Refund Failed")
- The refund audit trail is stored in the `PaymentAuditTrail` table in DynamoDB.

### 5. Backup Refund Data

- Periodic backups of refund data and associated audit logs are performed to ensure data redundancy and availability.
- A Lambda function, triggered by CloudWatch Events, periodically backs up the data to Amazon S3.

## Payment Refund Backup Flow

### Lambda Function for Refund Backup

- The Lambda function scans the DynamoDB `PaymentAuditTrail` table for records related to refunds.
- Refund records are serialized into a JSON backup file.

### Storing Refund Data in S3

- The JSON backup file is stored in Amazon S3 with a timestamp.
- CloudWatch Events can trigger this Lambda function periodically, such as daily backups.


### Summary of Payment Process and Refund Backup:

    Payment Process and Refund Process both need clear audit trails stored in DynamoDB. 

    These trails are important for tracing who initiated the transaction/refund, when it occurred, what data was accessed, and the result.

    The Lambda function automates the backup process by periodically exporting the records from DynamoDB to S3.

    By using CloudWatch Events, backups are scheduled automatically, ensuring the system is regularly backed up and compliant with data retention policies
